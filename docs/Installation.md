# Installation

## Basic Installation

You can load **Teapot** evaluating:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Teapot';
  repository: 'github://zeroflag/teapot:master/source';
  load.
```

> Change `master` to some released version if you want a pinned version

## Using as dependency

In order to include **Teapot** as part of your project, you should reference the
package in your product baseline:

```smalltalk
setUpDependencies: spec

  spec
    baseline: 'Teapot'
      with: [ spec
        repository: 'github://zeroflag/Teapot:v{XX}/source';
        loads: #('Deployment') ];
    import: 'Teapot'.
```

> Replace `{XX}` with the version you want to depend on

```smalltalk
baseline: spec

  baseline>
  spec
    for: #common
    do: [ self setUpDependencies: spec.
      spec package: 'My-Package' with: [ spec requires: #('Teapot') ] ]
```
